# This is my Java Template!

There are many like it, but this one is mine!

## Usage

### Coding

All code goes in the `/src` directory. Follow Java standards accordingly.

### Building

Use the `build.ps1` script to build the Java class files.

### Debugging

Debugging with vscode is already set up in the `/.vscode` directory, so you can start debugging from VSCode immediately.
